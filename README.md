### How to run
The D3 components need to be served up as HTML, if one just accesses index.html from file, the data cannot be access and the page will not render correctly. <br>
If there are any issues getting the visualisation to run, then please contact us. <br>
Outlined below are a number of ways to correctly serve up the visualisation:

#### Local Machine
  1. In terminal change directory to www
  2. Run ```pip -r requirements.txt```
  3. Run ```python runserver.py```
  4. Then browse to http://localhost:5555/
  
#### Web Server
Host the static html contained in the static folder of www/YoutubeTrends and access via HTML
