            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>
                YouTube is a probably the most popular video-sharing service in the world: 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute (according to their stats). Of those that achieve views in the billions, the great majority are music videos. We wanted to compare
                how the popularity of the five most watched YouTube videos changed over time, how they spread and how different countries compared to each other. We decided to use data on YouTube searches, comments on the videos and Google searches as
                a proxy for that popularity.
            </p>
            <h1> Data </h1>
            <p>
                While all the data we used is easily accessible, there is unfortunately no single place where it is bundled. We used a combination of custom code and
                <a href="https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends"> open source libraries </a> to download and get the data in a format we could use. This involved querying Google Trends for each song, country and source combination we needed and then
                parsing the YouTube comments for every video.

                            The first visualization we looked at was the Google+ ripples visualization, because we are looking at trends we thought it would be relevant as it shows how certain posts on google+ get shared and spread among the community. The problem with the visualization
                            is the fact it uses a 2D object i.e. the circles to represent 1D data i.e the number of shares. Also, the hierarchical structure used to show shares of shares by putting the sharers circles inside the original posts circle causes
                            an issue as, you are unable to see the posts lower down the hierarchy. Another problem with the visualisation is that some of the colours used are very similar to one another making it hard to distinguish between them.

                            We also looked at the visualizing of youtube channel information, specifically Top Gears channel. We liked the use of the line graph to show the overall popularity of each of the videos, as it gives a good overview of the initial trend. It also allows
                            you to be able to zoom into a specific range which we also tried to incorporate into our final visualization. The visualization also supports displaying information when hovering over a specific part of the line graph which
                            helps to give a more in depth information. This feature was also used in the final visualization.

                            The stat world visualization on the statsilk website is the closest visualization we could find to what we wanted. The use of the map to show the overall world wide data, as well as having the line graph to show the trends changing over time is very similar
                            to what we did in our final design. We also used the tooltip that shows the information for the country when you hover over the country, as shown in the image below allowing for more specific information similar to the Top
                            Gear visualization. The grey to red colour scheme was also very appealing as it allows for easy comparison between the different regions as it creates a clear boundary between each country.

                            In the visualization showing the drug-specific search prevalence in the US, although it does not seem as if it is in the scope of our topic, it is showing the search popularity which is similar to what we are looking at which is video popularity. The
                            multiple line graphs allow for easy comparison between the different types of drugs and since we are looking at comparing videos and the different information for those videos, we used the multiple lines on the line graphs
                            to also help aid comparison. The problem with this visualization is that the lines only differ from each other on one channel i.e. they only differ in colour. The use of a unique texture as well for each line would have made
                            it easier to immediately tell the difference between the separate drugs being represented.

                            We also looked at the way that google trends visualizes the information for certain videos and again noticed the use of the map to compare regions and a slider to show the progression over time, as well as using line graphs to compare between the information
                            from two videos.

            <h1>Initial Design</h1>
            <div class="trends" style="display:inline-block">
                <div style="width: 45%;float:right;padding-left:30px">
                    <div class="well">
                        <img src="img/inital.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div style="width: 55%;float:left">
                    <p>
                        In our initial design that we did during the class presentation we had set it up so that two videos can be chosen and compared at the same time. The whole motivation for our design was comparing two separate things hence the reason for splitting the design
                        down the middle so the two videos could be easily compared. A overall problem was the fact that the design was not very appealing, which we would have to focus on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the top of the design was the selector where you select the two videos using the drop downs that you want to compare. Then information such as the title, view count, dislike count, like count, comment count, date published and next to all that an embedded
                        video for the selected video was displayed. The visualization also incorporated being able to select the type of trend i.e do you want to see the youtube trends for that visualization or the google trends for it?
                        This could also be selected using the drop downs next to the video names.The problem with this part of the visualization was the fact that it was quite boring as there was a lot of text and numbers used and no symbols so it meant
                        that there would be a lot of reading involved making it less appealing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below the top section is the map section. The map section shows, based on the deepness of the red, normalised popularity of a video for each country after a specific number of weeks after release of the video. The maps information is linked to a
                        slider below it that allows you to adjust the number of weeks after the video was released allowing you to compare the two different videos over a period of 52 weeks after their initial releases and also allowing you to be able
                        to see the change in popularity for a specific video over a certain amount of time. We chose to do weeks after release rather than the actual time frames due to the fact that some of the videos are released up to 2 years before
                        other ones. This is again in aid of being able to compare between the videos. The map also would allow for zooming to allow for easy selection for smaller countries as well as a tooltip on hover over of the countries giving the
                        normalised popularity value not just for the video you selected but also for the video you are comparing it to. The comments we got back on this was it was too difficult to tell the difference of popularities between certain ranges
                        as our colour gradient was too similar.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The last part of our initial design is the graphs that show the popularity of the selected video over time i.e it will display the number of comments, the number of google searches and the number of youtube searches over the 52 week period after the release.
                The graphs would also allow you to select the type of data i.e you may want to see only google trends and then the lines representing this data would stay and the rest of the lines would be greyed out, a merge function was also mentioned
                that would allow you to compare the two separate videos in one graph. The graphs also had a vertical black line that is linked to the slider that moved to the week selected in the slider, making it easier to relate the data from the map
                to the graph. The issues that were mentioned with this section was that the greyed out lines were difficult to see and also we only used one colour in the separate graphs making it hard to pick out what represents what and also the fact that
                no texture was used.
            </p>

            <h1>Second Iteration</h1>
            <p>
                The feedback from the initial design was overall positive, with criticism of the looks rather than the format. Our second iteration was mostly implementing our initial mockup to get a better idea of how the parts would interact and look with real data.
                <br> The implementation was done with a suite of very awesome open source javascript libraries. [[[[LINK TO THEM!]]]]
            </p>
            <h3>The Header</h3>
            <p>
                This consists of two main parts: a selection bar that sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls down and an info section with stats about the video retrieved from YouTube (and the video itself embedded ). The selection bar has two functions: it
                allows the user to always quickly see what they are comparing and it allows the user to change what they are comparing without returning to the top of the page.
            </p>
            <h3>The Maps</h3>
            <p>
                The maps display the search volume data across the globe, normalized to the range 1-100. In practice this means that for each country, the week with the highest search volume is given a score of 100 and every other week is basically a percentage of that
                highest search volume. We feel this is justified as even if we had access to the raw numbers (which we actually don't) they would not be useful for comparing different countries to each other as we'd need to factor in many other variables
                (population, percentage with internet access etc).
                <br> They are zoomable, and the zoom is linked, so they always display the same view allowing for comparisons of smaller areas. The slider beneath the maps allows the user to see how the popularity changes over time, in one week increments
                from release date (as the videos were released in different years, we are only really interested in the changes relative to when it came out).
            </p>
            <h3>The Graphs</h3>
            <p>
            <p>
                The graphs initially show global trends for the videos for the year after release. Clicking on a specific country on the relative map, however, causes a graph to switch to information about that specific country. The user can also zoom and pan on the
                graphs, plus hover for more information. The graph makes use of texture, colour and line width to differentiate the data and make it easier to query specific lines while allowing the user to hide information that they are not interested in (by toggling
                the buttons below the graph).
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on feedback from the initial iteration, the color scale was completely reworked, colours were chosen that were commonly associated with the brand: red for YouTube and blue for Google. Green was chosen for comments since it has a strong opposing contrast to red. To account for colour blindness, the biggest difference on the other channels is between the red and green.
            </p>
            <p>
                For an easier and more immediate comparison between the global trends, the graphs can be merged, so that all the data is displayed on a single larger graph. Colour is used to identify what the song is (with each line using a slightly different shade of the colour) and the same texture as used in the individual graphs is used to differentiate Google, YouTube and the comments. This still allows the lines to be
                rapidly differentiated even on the merged graph. Different colours were chosen for the merge graph since the shade of red and blue on the individual line graph is associated with the Google and YouTube metaphor.
            </p>
            </p>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>
                Feedback was again largely positive, with most of the criticism being directed towards making the visualization look better rather than adding features to it. More specifically we were told to make the separation of components clearer and to generally make it more
                visually appealing.
            </p>
            <h1>Final Polish</h1>
            <p>
                <a href="index.html">Click here to go to final version</a>
                <br> Having received positive feedback about the overall design of the visualization, we set out to polish it into something more appealing. Some initial small changes were to switch from highlighting the maps in a different colour to using depth
                through shading to make it pop and switching out the slider to something more pleasant on the eyes and that showed the range more clearly. We also added help pop-ups on hover that hopefully give the user a better idea of what is going
                on without cluttering the visualization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not being UI designers ourselves, we decided that the best way to approach the final modifications was to use well-defined guidelines. Being fans of Google's material design (which is also used extensively on YouTube) we turned to their
                <a
                    href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">design spec</a> for inspiration. The use of cards and depth in particular really makes the visualization much more interesting and more fun to interact with along with cleaner fonts. The use of depth helps to separate components and make them more prominent, hence more important.
            </p>
            <h1>Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>
            <p>
                Thanks to the extensive feedback received during the initial iterations, our visualization has come a long way.
                <br> Our visual queries are easy to answer, and the more appealing design, coupled with interactions most people will be familiar with (scroll to zoom on map, hover for more info etc) makes it fun to explore the data. It highlights interesting
                events like Gangnam Style peaking again as it hit one billion views (though work could be done on giving better details on what those events are).

            </p>
            <p>
                Our visualization has two major weaknesses: the first, more a matter of time to implement, is the limited number of videos. Farming the data is time consuming so while this could be a cool visualization if plugged directly into Google's databases, anyone
                else has to choose the videos beforehand rather than allowing the user to choose any video. The second is that it might not be immediately apparent what the user is looking at. The hover for more info help dialogues help, and most users
                will not feel a need to know specifically what is meant by "more popular" vs "less popular" but some might want more precise details.
            </p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                From our initial, stark, design we iterated until we settled on an appealing, fun to explore visualization, that allows the user to answer all visual queries with ease. With more direct access to the data this would be an even better visualization, allowing users to compare any two videos instead of a subset prepared in advanced, but even with out limited data it is interesting and encourages people to use it.

            <h1>Division of Labour </h1>
            <p>
                    Work was divided in the following way: <br>
                </p>
                <div class="tablediv" style="padding-left:30px">

                <table class="table table-striped table-hover" >
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th data-field="id">Name</th>
                        <th data-field="name">Work Done</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>

                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Brian Mc George</td>
                        <td>Line graphs, overall design and visualization styling and polishing (helped extensively with coding other areas)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Bryce Billing</td>
                        <td>Header, large portions of the report</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Calvin Brizzi</td>
                        <td>Maps, report formatting</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
                <p>
                    This worked well, though certain parts of the design required more coding than others (the line graphs for example). Overall the team worked well, communication was good and people were quick to respond and resolve issues.
